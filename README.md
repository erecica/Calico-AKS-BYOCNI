This reposetory is setup for a Workshop purpuse and demsotrates how to install Calico on Azure [AKS with Bring Your Own CNI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/use-byo-cni) setup. 

There are two methods to execute the steps to starup and clean up your AKS installation.

## Method 1
Clone and execute bash script

### 1. Clone this reposetory, cd into the folder, change execution promissons, setup the cluster and deploy the resources
```
git clone https://github.com/erecica/Calico-AKS-BYOCNI.git && cd Calico-AKS-BYOCNI && chmod +x *.sh && ./start-script.sh
```
> After about 5-10 min the cluster should be ready and the demo app should be deployed

### Cleanup the cluster en remove all the resources

```
./cleanup-script.sh
```

## Method 2

Execute the commands maually

## Create resources commands

### 1. Create a resource group for this workshop
``` 
az group create --name Calico-AKS-Resourcegroup --location $LOCATION
```

### 2. Create AKS cluster with no Kubernetes CNI pre-installed

```
az aks create --resource-group Calico-AKS-Resourcegroup --name Calico-AKS-Workshop --location westeurope --pod-cidr 192.168.0.0/16 --network-plugin none --generate-ssh-keys
```
> Note: It might take about 6-9 min 

### 3. Get credentials to allow you to access the cluster with kubectl

```
az aks get-credentials --resource-group Calico-AKS-Resourcegroup --name Calico-AKS-Workshop
```

### 4. Install the operator

```
kubectl create -f ./tigera-operator.yaml
```

### 5. Configure the Calico installation

```
kubectl create -f ./tigera-operator-installation.yaml
```

### 6. Deploying YAOBank 

```
kubectl apply -f ./yaobank-org.yaml
```

### 7. Verify our deployment

```
kubectl get deployments -A | egrep yao
```

### 8. Deploying a Load Balancer

```
kubectl apply -f ./yoabank-loadbalancer.yaml
```

### 9. Verify the service deployment

```
kubectl get svc -n yaobank-customer yaobank-customer
```

> Note: It might take 1-2 minutes for the loadbalancer service to acquire an external IP address. Once the external IP is vissable, you should be able to visit the demo app with your breowser.

##  Clean up

### 1. Removing the AKS Cluster

```
az aks delete --name Calico-AKS-Workshop --resource-group Calico-AKS-Resourcegroup -y 
```
> Note: It might take 3-6 minutes to delete the cluster


### 2. Removing the Azure Resource Group

```
az group delete --resource-group Calico-AKS-Resourcegroup -y
```

### 3. Removing the AKS Kubeconfig Entries

```
kubectl config delete-cluster Calico-AKS-Workshop
kubectl config delete-context Calico-AKS-Workshop
kubectl config delete-user clusterUser_Calico-AKS-Resourcegroup_Calico-AKS-Workshop

```

### 4. Deleting the Cloud Shell Instance

```
clouddrive unmount
```
